# Factors

I was curious if I can come up with a short program to come up with all the possible factors for a certain number. 
Turns out it's pretty easy.
I also wanted to write it as fast as possible. This took about 5 minutes, with optimization and minor fixes going to 10 minutes.

I was curious to see how the number of factors as you move up the number line. so I created factor as a separate function. I also displayed the numbers in a way so that each number, no matter how many digits it has, takes up the same space in order to create an accurate graph.

I then "graphed" the results:

The images below show the pattern from 1 to 100:

The images below show the pattern from 1 to 1000:

I did not find a particular pattern. The factors seem to increase as you move up the number line. The number 480 also has more factors than 1-1000.
